<h3> Thanksgiving from your student ( ISE G Section )</h3>
<div class="inside">
As the sem is ending I would like to thank you for teaching me and always clearing my doubts ma'am. I would always be grateful for you being my teacher ma'am. Your efforts in teaching has brought immense interest in me towards coding. More than being my teacher you were a good friend to me.
